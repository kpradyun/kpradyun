*Integrated M.Tech in Computer Science Engineering | University of Hyderabad*

A motivated software engineer with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in full-stack web development, system architecture, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy combining analytical puzzle-solving with UI/UX principles to build efficient, user-centric applications.

## 🔭 Current Focus
I am currently dedicating my time to a few long-term engineering initiatives:
* **TUI-do:** Developing a terminal-native Kanban board for the FOSS Hack event.
* **Enterprise Banking System:** Architecting a comprehensive, secure banking platform as a semester-long software engineering endeavor.
* **Code-Smell AI:** Training a machine learning model designed to detect "structural smells" in codebases.

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
* **Languages:** C, Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP
* **AI & Machine Learning:** LangChain, LangGraph, FAISS, Vector Embeddings, Groq, HuggingFace
* **Web Technologies:** ReactJS, Node.js, Puppeteer
* **Databases & Tools:** MongoDB, MySQL, Git, Docker, NetworkX
* **Core Concepts:** Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Compiler Design

## 🏆 Featured Work & Research

### Publications
**Structural Centrality Scoring (SCS) — *SmartCom 2026***
* Introduced a metric-driven workflow to transform static call graphs into actionable architectural insights.
* Developed a novel metric combining Betweenness Centrality and PageRank to identify architectural hotspots.
* Built a Python/NetworkX toolchain to filter architectural noise by 30%, differentiating between runtime overhead and structural importance.

### Key Projects
* **F1 Insight Agent:** Architected a specialized AI agent using LangGraph and Groq to perform multi-step reasoning over Formula 1 datasets. Integrated external APIs for real-time telemetry and race statistics.
* **Multi-Source RAG Pipeline:** Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using FAISS and Hugging Face embeddings to enable semantic search over unstructured documents, significantly reducing LLM hallucination rates through recursive character splitting.
* **Electricity Bill Generator:** Engineered a full-stack digitization platform for TSSPDCL billing cycles. Implemented a 3-tier RBAC system with automated logic for rolling arrears and late fines, plus a custom CSS engine for thermal-style receipts.
* **Headless Web Scraper:** Built a Puppeteer-based headless browser scraper to extract multi-category data, supported by custom REST API endpoints for triggering scrapes and retrieving sanitized CSV data.
